This website could work as a seed project for a wallet. We have merchants, companies and transactions.

A merchant can have many companies, but the company can belong to one merchant or no merchants, and the transaction belongs to one company. If the user changes a merchant for any transaction, the company which the transaction belongs to will be belonging to the new merchant and all the transactions which belong to this company will be changed to the new merchant.

In the merchants tab you will be seeing the amount spent to this merchant as dollars and as perectange.

There is a transaction in the database at january 2029, to let you test the filters.
